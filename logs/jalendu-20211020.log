You can post images from the internet including porn here but there are Discord servers for this purpose. See links in the promotions channel.

​**<#876889471608553532>** : This is a place to share and discuss our trauma or pain and to support one another.

Jalendu: **<#835771866064093184>** : There aren’t any rules here. Yes, this is a place where you can masturbate or otherwise behave sexually online either alone or with others,where you can observe, be observed or both. There are many servers on Discord where you can jerk-off with other guys on camera, (and you can also do it privately in direct messages), so what is different about this one?
This is a group focussed on meditation and yoga and by extension, mindfulness, self-awareness, self-realisation, embodiment and self-acceptance. Hopefully we can bring some of those aims to our sexual or otherwise behaviour in this channel. If there are any rules they are to accept others but more importantly accept ourselves.

​
GUILD_TEXT : channels-directory
Jalendu: **<#827888294100074519>** : #general is where you can chat about anything. It doesn’t have to be about meditation but please keep it safe for work and suitable for ages 14+.

​**<#900243601303420988>** : Question of the Week discussion.

​**<#893213385951420436>** : This is a place to post and talk about photos. Mostly these would be photos that you have taken yourself of your travels, garden, pets, house... anything. It doesn't have to be related to meditation or yoga (but all of life is sacred). Please keep it suitable for ages 14+.

​**<#827891337125822524>** : #meditation-and-yoga is for chat, images, links etc. somehow related to meditation or yoga practice. Also sfw and suitable for 14+.

​**<#834018953834922005>** : A channel for anyone to announce when and where they will be sitting online so that others may join them if they can.

​**<#876984373705052190>** : The #apollo-events channel is managed by the Apollo bot and contains events listings. To add an event, type :

!event

as a message in any other channel, though preferably in #bot-commands and then follow the prompts in direct messages from Apollo.

​**<#859691760980066334>** : Here you can promote anything including anything you are selling or doing. Members can mute this channel if they are not interested.

​**<#861357967966339112>** : Post links from youtube or elsewhere for guided meditations that you think are appropriate for this group. These may be used with the Rythm bot to be used in a group meditation.

​**<#876586095020761128>** : This is a place to share and discuss our trauma or pain and to support one another.

​**VIDEO CHANNELS**

Jalendu: **<#827890804701003827>** : Open-meditation-room is for unscheduled, random meditation alone or with whoever wants to join. Microphone off please. Bow (or just nod) with palms together when you enter or leave the room, not when others do. Better not to sit directly facing the camera. People will be facing a wall in some forms of meditation. It’s okay to have your back to the camera.

​**<#878067342888808448>** : open-yoga-room is where you can practice yoga online. Microphone off unless you are leading a session. Bow when entering and leaving.

​**<#827993501920657479>** : scheduled-meditation-room is for if we have a specific meditation meeting or class. Etiquette set by the event organiser.

GUILD_TEXT : server-announcements
marq_andrew: 🙇‍♂️  Please remember that this server is not a sexual, hookup or porn server and is open to anyone aged 14+. Nudity or sexual images are allowed only in the channels prefixed “nsfw” and members must state that they are 18+ before they have access to them. In addition, moderators can lock members out of the nsfw channels if necessary. 
I reject any suggestion that young teenagers <18 should be treated differently or excluded from this server on the basis that it is for gay+ men where they wouldn’t be on any other non-sexually focussed server.
It is a fact however that some young teenagers have joined this group because they are sexually attracted to older men and contact members via direct message for sexual role playing etc.. Direct messages are facilitated by accepting a friend request or by being mutual members of at least one server (on which you have not blocked direct messages) but they do not go ”through” the servers.
If you become aware of a young teenager who has been untruthful about their age and is accessing or especially showing images or video of themselves in the nsfw channels, please contact a moderator. However, YOU are the moderators of your direct messages. You can block direct messages from an individual or block direct messages from all members of a server (ineffective if you are friends or mutual members of another server).
Please DO NOT contact the server moderators about incidents that occur in direct messages.
(Some gratuitous advice about online safety; Never assume a person you are chatting to sexually online is 18+. That they might have lied about their age often isn’t a defence.)

RGfinpsy: Ig almost everything have some idea about meditation. Most people understand meditation as a task where you sit with eyes close and try to stay calm and focus. 

But still if someone totally clueless ask me to explain him what is meditation ill say that in meditation your main goal is to be with yourself in a place where you can stay calm, undisturbed, and try to clear your mind. You give your mind and body a chance to do absolutely nothing and stay calm and relaxed.

marq_andrew: I would say “living in reality”. I practice a kind of meditation called Shikantaza which means “just sitting”. It means sitting in awareness of everything that is or happens, not conceptualising or engaging mentally, without expectation or goal, but also with the unthought awareness that this is reality and this is what the Buddha did.
GUILD_TEXT : qotw
RGfinpsy: Very good 👌
