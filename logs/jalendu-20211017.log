Jalendu: __These are the instructions for adding questions for regular discussion on G+MM__

* It is best to add your question in a direct message with @Jalendu. Direct message Jalendu as you would any real user.

* Every request or instruction to the questions system starts with "/qo". This tells Jalendu (a program) that you are referring to the questions system.

* Questions are asked in the channel anonymously and in random order but your user name is recorded with each question so that only you (or a mod) can edit the questions that you have added.

* Questions can be as long or short as you like but try to make it something that invites discussion. You can add photos to your question. Questions can be controversial and push boundaries but keep in mind that they will be displayed in a sfw channel to invite maximum participation.
GUILD_TEXT : test_landing-zone
Jalendu: ​
__Adding a question__

To add a question, enter ```/qo add [your question]``` as a message.

You can attach a photo to your question if you want to. You can do this later with the attach command (see below) or at the same time as you add the question by clicking on the + to the left of the message field, selecting "Upload a file", choose your photo (or etc.) and press Open, enter ```/qo add [your question]``` in the ADD A COMMENT field and then press Upload.

Jalendu will reply with # plus the id of your question and the question itself. You will need the id number if you want to change the question you added.

__Listing your questions__

To list the questions that you have previously added, enter ```/qo list [id]``` [id] refers to the question id number you saw after the question was added. If you leave it out, all of your questions will be listed but not any images attached to them. You only get the image if you list them one at a time but you have to list all questions to see the question status (submitted/approved/rejected/deleted)

__Finding a question__

To find only the questions that you have previously added that contain certain words, enter ```/qo find [words]```
GUILD_TEXT : test_landing-zone
Jalendu: ​
__Editing a question__

To edit the text of a previously entered question, enter ```/qo edit [id] [your revised question]```This will only change the question. If you attached a photo to your question, it will be unchanged.

__Attaching a photo to a question__

To attach photo (or file) to a previously entered question, press the + on the left of the  message field, select "Upload a file", choose your photo (or etc.) then press Open, enter ```/qo attach [id]``` in the ADD A COMMENT field and then press Upload. This will only change the photo attached to the question, not the text of the question.

__Detaching a photo from a question__

To remove the photo from a question while leaving the question itself intact, enter ```/qo detach [id]```

__Deleting a question__

To delete your question, enter ```/qo delete [id]```

__Undeleting a question__

It is possible to undelete a question if not too much time has passed since you deleted it. To get a list of deleted questions that are still recoverable, enter ```/qo deleted```To undelete your question, enter ```/qo undelete [id]```

__Bumping a question__

Questions are inserted into the list in random order. To lower the order of a question so that it will come up sooner, enter ```/qo bump [id]```

__System status__

To get information about the questions system including the number of questions left and the time of the next question, enter ```/qo status```
GUILD_TEXT : test_landing-zone
Jalendu: ​


**__Moderator Only Commands__**

All of the commands available to general users (above) work for moderators but moderators can see and edit all questions, not just their own. Editing a user's question doesn't change their ownership of it so they can still edit it. Similarly deleting a user's question doesn't stop them undeleting it until a hard delete is done.

__Reviewing Questions__

When a question is added or edited, it goes into "submitted" status and is not yet available to be asked. They need to be approved before they can be asked. To read all of the questions needing approval enter ```/qo review```

__Approval__

Enter ```/qo approve [id|all]``` to approve the question with id, or 'all' to approve all submitted questions.

Egidio: Ron, this is so timely. For 65 years of my life, I'd been a voracious meat eater. On July 22 this year, I was diagnosed with fatty liver. In brief that is a condition that if left untreated can lead to cirrhosis and cause death. I don't drink. So, in my case, that would be called non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Back to my story, on July 22, my doctor said I'd have to switch to a 90% plant-based diet. The list of what I can and cannot eat was 3 pages long. I figured the easiest way would be to become a vegan since dairy and eggs were in the no-list of foods. Even though I was allowed to have eggs 1-2 times a week and chicken 1-2 a week and no more than 4 oz each time, I found that going vegan would be the easiest -- and most radical! Well, two and half months later, my liver is pretty much back to normal. However, the most remarkable things were the beneficial side effects of the food switch. First off, I lost 12 pounds by simply eating a healthier diet. I also lowered my blood pressure and had to eliminate one of my high blood pressure medications. I was never a fat person, but losing the weight was a blessing and something I wanted. I have plenty of energy and feel very satisfied with the food I eat. Furthermore, there are tons of plant-based "meats" out there nowadays, from bacon to Italian sausage and ground beef. So, if I have cravings for those, I can easily find them in our grocery stores. Austin is such an easy city to live and eat well. Even vegan barbecue sandwiches are available in food trucks and restaurants.

Jalendu: __These are the instructions for adding questions for regular discussion on G+MM__

* It is best to add your question in a direct message with @Jalendu. Direct message Jalendu as you would any real user.

* Every request or instruction to the questions system starts with "/qo". This tells Jalendu (a program) that you are referring to the questions system.

* Questions are asked in the channel anonymously and in random order but your user name is recorded with each question so that only you (or a mod) can edit the questions that you have added.

* Questions can be as long or short as you like but try to make it something that invites discussion. You can add photos to your question. Questions can be controversial and push boundaries but keep in mind that they will be displayed in a sfw channel to invite maximum participation.

Jalendu: ​
__Adding a question__

To add a question, enter ```/qo add [your question]``` as a message.

You can attach a photo to your question if you want to. You can do this later with the attach command (see below) or at the same time as you add the question by clicking on the + to the left of the message field, selecting "Upload a file", choose your photo (or etc.) and press Open, enter ```/qo add [your question]``` in the ADD A COMMENT field and then press Upload.

Jalendu will reply with # plus the id of your question and the question itself. You will need the id number if you want to change the question you added.

__Listing your questions__

To list the questions that you have previously added, enter ```/qo list [id]``` [id] refers to the question id number you saw after the question was added. If you leave it out, all of your questions will be listed as well as the question status the question status (submitted/approved/rejected/deleted) but not any images attached to them.
You only get the image if you list them one at a time which shows the question in the format in which it will be asked. 

__Finding a question__

To find only the questions that you have previously added that contain certain words, enter ```/qo find [words]```
GUILD_TEXT : test_landing-zone
Jalendu: ​
__Editing a question__

To edit the text of a previously entered question, enter ```/qo edit [id] [your revised question]```This will only change the question. If you attached a photo to your question, it will be unchanged.

__Attaching a photo to a question__

To attach photo (or file) to a previously entered question, press the + on the left of the  message field, select "Upload a file", choose your photo (or etc.) then press Open, enter ```/qo attach [id]``` in the ADD A COMMENT field and then press Upload. This will only change the photo attached to the question, not the text of the question.

__Detaching a photo from a question__

To remove the photo from a question while leaving the question itself intact, enter ```/qo detach [id]```

__Deleting a question__

To delete your question, enter ```/qo delete [id]```

__Undeleting a question__

It is possible to undelete a question if not too much time has passed since you deleted it. To get a list of deleted questions that are still recoverable, enter ```/qo deleted```To undelete your question, enter ```/qo undelete [id]```

__Bumping a question__

Questions are inserted into the list in random order. To lower the order of a question so that it will come up sooner, enter ```/qo bump [id]```

__System status__

To get information about the questions system including the number of questions left and the time of the next question, enter ```/qo status```

__Help__

To get help about the questions system commands (that you are reading right now), enter ```/qo help```

**__Moderator Only Commands__**

All of the commands available to general users (above) work for moderators but moderators can see and edit all questions, not just their own. Editing a user's question doesn't change their ownership of it so they can still edit it. Similarly deleting a user's question doesn't stop them undeleting it until a hard delete is done.

__Reviewing Questions__

When a question is added or edited, it goes into "submitted" status and is not yet available to be asked. They need to be approved before they can be asked. To read all of the questions needing approval enter ```/qo review```

__Approval and rejection__

Enter ```/qo approve [id|all]``` to approve the question with id, or 'all' to approve all submitted questions.
To reject a question, enter ```/qo reject [id]``` There is no 'all' option for reject.

__Starting and stopping the questions system__

Enter```/qo start [n]```To start the questions system in the current channel in [n] hours time. Leave out n to start immediately.

Jalendu: __These are the instructions for adding questions for regular discussion on G+MM__

* It is best to add your question in a direct message with @Jalendu. Direct message Jalendu as you would any real user.

* Every request or instruction to the questions system starts with "/qo". This tells Jalendu (a program) that you are referring to the questions system.

* Questions are asked in the channel anonymously and in random order but your user name is recorded with each question so that only you (or a mod) can edit the questions that you have added.

* Questions can be as long or short as you like but try to make it something that invites discussion. You can add photos to your question. Questions can be controversial and push boundaries but keep in mind that they will be displayed in a sfw channel to invite maximum participation.
GUILD_TEXT : test_landing-zone
Jalendu: ​
__Adding a question__

To add a question, enter ```/qo add [your question]``` as a message.

You can attach a photo to your question if you want to. You can do this later with the attach command (see below) or at the same time as you add the question by clicking on the + to the left of the message field, selecting "Upload a file", choose your photo (or etc.) and press Open, enter ```/qo add [your question]``` in the ADD A COMMENT field and then press Upload.

Jalendu will reply with # plus the id of your question and the question itself. You will need the id number if you want to change the question you added.

__Listing your questions__

To list the questions that you have previously added, enter ```/qo list [id]``` [id] refers to the question id number you saw after the question was added. If you leave it out, all of your questions will be listed as well as the question status the question status (submitted/approved/rejected/deleted) but not any images attached to them.
You only get the image if you list them one at a time which shows the question in the format in which it will be asked. 

__Finding a question__

To find only the questions that you have previously added that contain certain words, enter ```/qo find [words]```
GUILD_TEXT : test_landing-zone
Jalendu: ​
__Editing a question__

To edit the text of a previously entered question, enter ```/qo edit [id] [your revised question]```This will only change the question. If you attached a photo to your question, it will be unchanged.

__Attaching a photo to a question__

To attach photo (or file) to a previously entered question, press the + on the left of the  message field, select "Upload a file", choose your photo (or etc.) then press Open, enter ```/qo attach [id]``` in the ADD A COMMENT field and then press Upload. This will only change the photo attached to the question, not the text of the question.

__Detaching a photo from a question__

To remove the photo from a question while leaving the question itself intact, enter ```/qo detach [id]```
__Deleting a question__

To delete your question, enter ```/qo delete [id]```
__Undeleting a question__

It is possible to undelete a question if not too much time has passed since you deleted it. To get a list of deleted questions that are still recoverable, enter ```/qo deleted```To undelete your question, enter ```/qo undelete [id]```
__Bumping a question__

Questions are inserted into the list in random order. To lower the order of a question so that it will come up sooner, enter ```/qo bump [id]```
__System status__

To get information about the questions system including the number of questions left and the time of the next question, enter ```/qo status```
__Help__

To get help about the questions system commands (that you are reading right now), enter ```/qo help```
GUILD_TEXT : test_landing-zone
Jalendu: ​


**__Moderator only commands__**

All of the commands available to general users (above) work for moderators but moderators can see and edit all questions, not just their own. Editing a user's question doesn't change their ownership of it so they can still edit it. Similarly deleting a user's question doesn't stop them undeleting it until a hard delete is done.

__Reviewing Questions__

When a question is added or edited, it goes into "submitted" status and is not yet available to be asked. They need to be approved before they can be asked. To read all of the questions needing approval enter ```/qo review```
__Approval and rejection__

Enter ```/qo approve [id|all]``` to approve the question with id, or 'all' to approve all submitted questions.
To reject a question, enter ```/qo reject [id]``` There is no 'all' option for reject.

__Starting and stopping the questions system__

Enter```/qo start [n]```To start the questions system in the current channel in [n] hours time. Leave out n to start immediately.
To stop the system, enter```/qo stop```
__Questions Reset__

Too make all questions available to be asked again, enter```/qo reset```
__Shuffle Questions__

To resort the questions in random order, enter```/qo randomise [clear]``` The 'clear' option will zero all bumps.

#23 ```Henry Scott Tuke (1858-1929) was an English painter. He had no known relationships with women other than his sister. He was friends with Oscar Wilde and other "Uranians" and wrote poetry that idealised the love of Ancient Greece. Since the 1970's he has become " something of a cult figure in gay cultural circles" and Elton John has a large collection of his works (-for some reason-). There is however no direct evidence that he was gay and a small number of Tuke curators push back at any suggestion that he was or that his art is homoerotic.
