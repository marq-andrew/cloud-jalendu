GUILD_TEXT : server-announcements
marq_andrew: 🙇‍♂️  After some discussion about coordination of group practice times in the various vc rooms, we decided that when you can remember, 10 or 15 minutes prior to when you are going to practice, ping either <@&881813694420500520> or <@&881813802268655686> in a message in the <#834018953834922005> channel to alert anyone who might be available to join you.
GUILD_TEXT : server-announcements
marq_andrew: 🙇‍♂️  Also, it was suggested that we do a survey to determine when people are available and intend to practice online here. I thought the best way to do that is to record when the vc rooms are actually being used most often and publish that in a timetable that is continuously updated. Then you can not only check the timetable to see when people are practicing in the vc rooms, you can add the time that is most convenient for you to the timetable, and inform others so that they can join you, simply by actually practicing in the vc room at that time.
GUILD_TEXT : server-announcements
marq_andrew: 🙇‍♂️  I have made this timetable as an external web page: 
https://jalendu.marqandrew.repl.co/?function=vcmon
GUILD_TEXT : server-announcements
marq_andrew: 🙇‍♂️  Since it has only been going for less than 2 days, there isn’t much on the timetable yet but as people use the vc rooms, the sessions will be added. You will just have to refresh the page to see them. The more often a room is used at a certain time, the darker the colour of that time in the timetable and the bigger the number. It represents a rolling 14 days of activity to keep it current.
GUILD_TEXT : server-announcements
marq_andrew: 🙇‍♂️   Behind the scenes, only the vc room name, half hour segment and minutes are being recorded for this. Not anyone’s name or ID.
The timetable is an external web page for several reasons, the most important of which is that I can use client side code to calculate your local time, avoiding problems of so many different time zones. It is also very difficult to write a nice looking table on Discord (or at least I don’t know how).

marq_andrew: Hi. As I said in <#880224417475600414>. I have made a timetable of practice times:
https://jalendu.marqandrew.repl.co/?function=vcmon
This timetable is updated automatically by actually using the vc rooms. The more often a room is used at a certain time, the darker the colour. Since I only just started it, there isn’t a lot there yet but it will grow. The local time column is YOUR time so no time zone conversion issues. <@&881813694420500520> & <@&881813802268655686>

Egidio: Has anyone had a personal experience with any of those frozen things that are sold to help with hemorrhoids? A friend recommended AnuIce, and I have also heard of HemorrWedge. The former is like a butt plug, whereas the latter is totally external and you just wedge it between your cheeks. Both products can be seen on Amazon, if you're curious. The reason I'm asking is that after 35 years, I had a bad flare-up of hemorrhoids (external only).
