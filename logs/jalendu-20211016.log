marq_andrew: I tried it this morning straight after my early morning meditation. I could maintain awareness and feel my body going to sleep and my senses shutting down. Then immediately the dreams started and I was aware for a moment but the dreams themselves distracted me so after that I suppose I was normally asleep and I don’t remember anything. I will try again but it wasn’t a very pleasant thing to do. It didn’t feel good for some reason.

Jalendu: __These are the instructions for adding questions for regular discussion on G+MM__

* It is best to add your question in a direct message with @Jalendu. Direct message Jalendu as you would any real user.

* Every request or instruction to the questions system starts with "/qo". This tells Jalendu (a program) that you are referring to the questions system.

* Questions are asked in the channel anonymously and in random order but your user name is recorded with each question so that only you can edit the questions that you have added.

* Questions can be as long or short as you like but try to make it something that invites discussion. You can add photos to your question. Questions can be controversial and push boundaries but keep in mind that they will be displayed in a sfw channel to invite maximum participation.
GUILD_TEXT : test_landing-zone
Jalendu: ​
__Adding a question__

To add a question, enter ```/qo add [your question]``` as a message.

You can attach a photo to your question if you want to. You can do this later with the attach command (see below) or at the same time as you add the question by clicking on the + to the left of the message field, selecting "Upload a file", choose your photo (or etc.) and press Open, enter ```/qo add [your question]``` in the ADD A COMMENT field and then press Upload.

Jalendu will reply with # plus the id of your question and the question itself. You will need the id number if you want to change the question you added.

__Listing your questions__

To list the questions that you have previously added, enter ```/qo list [id]``` [id] refers to the question id number you saw after the question was added. If you leave it out, all of your questions will be listed but not any images attached to them. You only get the image if you list them one at a time.

__Finding a question__

To find only the questions that you have previously added that contain certain words, enter ```/qo find [words]```
GUILD_TEXT : test_landing-zone
Jalendu: ​
__Editing a question__

To edit the text of a previously entered question, enter ```/qo edit [id] [your revised question]```This will only change the question. If you attached a photo to your question, it will be unchanged.

__Attaching a photo to a question__

To attach photo (or file) to a previously entered question, press the + on the left of the  message field, select "Upload a file", choose your photo (or etc.) then press Open, enter ```/qo attach [id]``` in the ADD A COMMENT field and then press Upload. This will only change the photo attached to the question, not the text of the question.

__Detaching a photo from a question__

To remove the photo from a question while leaving the question itself intact, enter ```/qo detach [id]```

__Deleting a question__

To delete your question, enter ```/qo delete [id]```

__Undeleting a question__

It is possible to undelete a question if not too much time has passed since you deleted it. To get a list of deleted questions that are still recoverable, enter ```/qo deleted```To undelete your question, enter ```/qo undelete [id]```

__System status__

To get information about the questions system including the number of questions left and the time of the next question, enter ```/qo status```
GUILD_TEXT : test_landing-zone
Jalendu: ​


**__Moderator Only Commands__**

All of the commands available to general users (above) work for moderators but moderators can see and edit all questions, not just their own. Editing a user's question doesn't change their ownership of it so they can still edit it. Similarly deleting a user's question doesn't stop them undeleting it until a hard delete is done.

__Reviewing Questions__When a question is added or edited, it goes into "submitted" status and is not yet available to be asked. They need to be approved before they can be asked. To see all of the questions needing approval enter ```/qo review```

__Approval__

Enter ```/qo approve [id|all]``` to approve the question with id, or 'all' to approve all submitted questions.
