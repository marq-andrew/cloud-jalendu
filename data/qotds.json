      "question": "Henry Scott Tuke (1858-1929) was an English painter. He had no known relationships with women other than his sister. He was friends with Oscar Wilde and other \"Uranians\" and wrote poetry that idealised the love of Ancient Greece. Since the 1970's he has become \" something of a cult figure in gay cultural circles\" and Elton John has a large collection of his works (-for some reason-). There is however no direct evidence that he was gay and a small number of Tuke curators push back at any suggestion that he was or that his art is homoerotic.\nWhat do you feel about “gay erasure” of historical figures? Is it important to oppose it or do gay people make too much fuss about it?",
