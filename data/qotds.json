Is the fact that in many species of animal, the males are more attractive than the females relevant?",

Since the 1970's he has become \" something of a cult figure in gay cultural circles\" and Elton John has a large collection of his works (-for some reason-). There is however no direct evidence that he was gay and a small number of Tuke curators push back at any suggestion that he was or that his art is homoerotic.\nWhat do you feel about “gay erasure” of historical figures?

It’s time to end the false equivalency.\" \nDo you agree? Is it ok to discriminate against a person because of their religious beliefs? On the other hand, is it rational to allow someone an exemption from the law on the basis of what they choose to believe?",

      "question": "“The customer rang and said that they’re coming in this afternoon to pick up their order. I thanked them for their patience.”\nUsing the pronouns they, their and them for a single person is common and correct English usage, usually when you don’t know their gender. Why is it then that when a person says that they’d prefer others to refer to them using those pronouns (they/their/them), some people object on the grounds that it doesn’t seem to be correct grammar to refer to a single person using them?\nIf you speak another language, what pronouns do you use for a person when you don’t know their gender?",
